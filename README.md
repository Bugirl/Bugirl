# Hi there 👋, My name is Izabela
## 🔎 Software Tester
I'm Polish, living in the Canary Islands. In September 2021, I started my adventure with software testing, trying my hand on uTest. Until today, I have participated in tens of test cycles, testing products of well-known global brands. I am self-taught, currently learning Cypress and SQL. Privately a fan of snorkeling, board games and an actress of children's theater. I speak Polish, English and Spanish.
